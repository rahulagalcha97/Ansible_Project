# Ansible_Complete_Guide


What is an Ansible?
-> Ansible is a radically simple IT automation engine that automates cloud provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, intra-service orchestration, and many other IT needs.

Ansible is:
-Simple
-Agentless
-Powerfull

Ansible has a number of important strengths:
-Cross platform support
-Human-readable automation
-Easy to manage in version control
-Support for dynamic inventories
-Easy integration with other systems like Jenkins/HP SA.

Ansible Concepts and Architecture:
- There are two types of machines in the Ansible architecture:
1: Control Node
2: Managed Hosts

Ansible is installed and run from the control node.
Managed hosts are listed in an inventory.

Instead of writing complex scripts, ansible users create high level "plays" to ensure a host or group of hosts are in a particular state.
A "play" performs a series of tasks on the host/hosts in the order specified by the "play". This plays are specified in YAML format in a text file.
The file that contains one or more plays is called "playbook".

Each "Task" runs a "Module" (A small piece of code) Ansible ships with hundreds of modules that can perform a wide variety of automation tasks.

Module generally ensures that some particular thing about the machine is in a particular state.

-Ansible also uses plug-ins which are code that you can add to ansible to extend it and adapt it to new uses and platforms.

(The ansible is Agentless, Typically when an Administrator runs an ansible playbook or an Ad-Hoc command, The control node connects to the managed hosts using ssh by default or WinRM. Meaning that client don't need to have an ansible-specific agent installed on managed hosts., and don't need to permit special tracffic to some non-standard port.

Installing Ansible:

Ansible is simple to install. The ansible package only needs to be installed on the control node/nodes form which Ansible will be run.
Hosts that are managed by ansible do not need to have ansible installed. 

- The control node should be a Linux system. (Microsoft Windows isnt support as control node although it can be managed hosts)

Prerequsite: 
-Python 2.6 or later.  (On managed hosts as well)

(if you are managing Microsoft Windows systems, you also need to have version 0.2.2 or later of the python2-winrm
RPM package installed (which provides the pywinrm Python package)

(If the version of Python installed on the managed host is earlier than Python 2.5, then the python-simplejson
package must also be installed.)
#yum list installed python
